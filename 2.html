            Among the many OnePlus devices that the smartphone maker wants to introduce this year is a smartphone called
            OnePlus Ace.

            According to a report by GSMArena(opens in new tab), the first phone in this lineup might be a gaming-focused
             device with a Dimensity 8100 SoC and may sport 150W fast charging, which was recently introduced by Realme.

            Now, in case you’ve been following the news of numerous OnePlus leaks recently, then you might remember that
            these are the same specs of a probable OnePlus 10R. According to the tipster Digital Chat Station, this phone
            was codenamed “Pickle” and is probably going to be launched as Ace.

            In case you remember, Oppo had launched a phone under the Ace lineup called Oppo Ace in 2019 and its successor
            Ace 2 arrived in 2020. It was odd that the company canceled this lineup abruptly, however, now we know why it 
            was done.

            According to the tipster, the phone with a model number PGKM10 is expected to come with a center-aligned hole-punch
            display and a textured back – a design language that we can relate to almost all OnePlus devices.

            The phone is said to be a rebranded version of Realme GT Neo 3, and hence apart from some cosmetic changes, the core
            specifications are expected to remain the same. It is safe to say that the OnePlus Ace might come with a 6.7-inch
            AMOLED display with a 120 Hz refresh rate and Full HD + resolution. In terms of optics, the phone is expected to
            come with a 50MP primary sensor with OIS and a 4500 mAh battery with 150W fast charging.

            While the Realme GT Neo 3 has been teased to launch in India soon, the OnePlus Ace is still some time away from a 
            launch. The phone is tipped to launch in China in the next quarter followed by its wider rollout in the International 
            markets including India.

            In a piece of related news, the OnePlus Ace has already been spotted(opens in new tab) on the Geekbench platform 
            revealing its key specifications. The leak corroborates with the previous leaks and suggests that a OnePlus phone 
            with a model number PGKM10 is expected to be a powerful midrange device with ultra-fast charging tech in tow.
