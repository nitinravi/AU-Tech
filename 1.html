        Making public on Twitter a note that he had shared with his company, Parag said: "Elon's appointment
        Tesla CEO Elon Musk is infamous for using Twitter to tease and tease out various ideas he has about his 
        business interests, cryptocurrency, politics and life in general, but today it looks like he’s making 
        good on one of the biggest of his musings. Twitter has announced that it has accepted Musk’s offer to 
        acquire the publicly traded company at $54.20/share, valuing the social media platform at $44 billion.

        Moments after the news broke that Twitter trading was halted, the company issued a press release 
        confirming that it was accepting Musk’s offer to take the social network private.

        “The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon’s proposal with a 
        deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,” Twitter’s Independent Board Chair Bret Taylor said 
        of the deal. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the 
        best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”

        In the press release, Musk repeated his refrain that “free speech” is key to Twitter’s future, though most 
        of his ideas for how to optimize the social network, including adding new products, fighting spam and 
        opening up its algorithms, are things the company was already in the process of doing prior to his 
        dramatic intervention.

        “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters 
        vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said.

        “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms 
        open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous 
        potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.”

        It’s not clear from Musk’s statement what exactly he means by “authenticating all humans” — is that just the 
        ongoing work of ridding the platform of spammy bots or a new, stricter stance on non-human automated accounts? 
        If the latter, that would certainly change Twitter’s flavor as a social platform that’s long been home to useful 
        and occasionally delightful bot accounts.

        Twitter says the transaction, which was unanimously approved by the board, will likely close this year following 
        shareholder and regulatory approval and “the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.” Until those 
        matters are resolved, it’s not a done deal.

        The news comes after strategically placed reports from overnight that Twitter — contrary to earlier statements 
        about the poison pill it would prefer over Musk acquiring it — was entertaining the offer.

        The Twitter/Musk acquisition dance has been a pretty short one, especially considering the size of the deal: It 
        started less than a month ago, when Musk first took to Twitter to make lots of pointed comments about social 
        networks and Twitter itself and what it’s not doing well, only for Twitter to disclose on April 4 that Musk had 
        in fact taken a significant $3 billion stake — some 9.2% of shares in the company.

        A Musk-shaped seat on the board swiftly followed before being pulled away. Shareholders were annoyed with Musk 
        and sued him over what they believed was obvious share price manipulation.

        And Musk? Musk doubled down and said that actually he’d just prefer to buy the whole damn platform. That was on 
        April 14. The board balked and the poison pill made a viral interlude in the world of corporate tech news.

        But Musk, currently the world’s richest individual on paper, simply pressed on, spelled out how he would finance 
        such a deal, and suddenly everyone started to take him seriously. Money always talks.

        Overnight — last night — the leaks began to drip out about Twitter considering the deal after all.

        The news is bound to upset a lot of people — Musk has a tendency to polarize, and so does Twitter, so it’s 
        basically a given.
        And so it will be intriguing to see what that spells out about Twitter as a business. It will also be worth 
        watching to figure out just what Musk’s agenda or intention may be. Moguls buying up media properties 
        is not exactly novel — we’d argue it’s the next (big) step up in the same trajectory that includes yachts 
        and other iconic assets.

        Musk, however, has been a Twitter power user for a long time, which means it’s likely that he will be 
        approaching this as more than an investors’ vanity play or a purely financial play. He has ideas. And even if 
        you don’t like him, you have to admit he’s smart. He may have plans to turn Twitter into a bigger and profitable 
        business. Or, he may have already decided that Twitter is much more fun as an expensive plaything and a lever 
        for juicing other interests (which is, for all intents and purposes, the only thing we have proof of him using 
        Twitter for so far).

        Whichever it is, if he has his way he will now have a mouthpiece that he can control as he pleases.
